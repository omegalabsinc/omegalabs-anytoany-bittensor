## Introduction

**OMEGA Any-to-Any** is a decentralized, open-source AI project built on the Bittensor blockchain by OMEGA Labs. Our mission is to create state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal any-to-any models by attracting the world's top AI researchers to train on Bittensor, taking advantage of Bittensor's incentivized intelligence platform. Our goal is to establish a self-sustaining, well-resourced research lab, where participants are rewarded for contributing compute and/or research insight.

**TestNet UID**: 157

## Why Any-to-Any? üß†üìöüåÉüéßüé•

- **Multimodal First**: A2A jointly models all modalities (text, image, audio, video) at once, with the belief that true intelligence lies in the associative representations present at the intersection of all modalities.
- **Unified Fundamental Representation of Reality**: The [Platonic Representation Hypothesis](https://phillipi.github.io/prh/) suggests that as AI models increase in scale and capability, they converge towards a shared, fundamental representation of reality. A2A models, by jointly modeling all modalities, are uniquely positioned to capture this underlying structure, potentially accelerating the path towards more general and robust AI.
- **Decentralized Data Collection**: Thanks to our [SN24 data collection](https://github.com/omegalabsinc/omegalabs-bittensor-subnet), we leverage a fresh stream of data that mimics real-world demand distribution for training and evaluation. By frequently refreshing our data collection topics based on gaps in the current data, we avoid the issue of underrepresented data classes (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04125) for more discussion on this issue). Through self-play, our SN's best checkpoints can learn from each other and pool their intelligence.
- **Incentivized Research**: World class AI researchers and engineers already love open source. With Bittensor's model for incentivizing intelligence, researchers can be permissionlessly compensated for their efforts and have their compute subsidized according to their productivity.
- **Bittensor Subnet Orchestrator**: Incorporates specialist models from other Bittensor subnets, acting as a high-bandwidth, general-purpose router. By being the best open source natively multimodal model, future AI projects can leverage our rich multimodal embeddings to bootstrap their own expert models.
- **Public-Driven Capability Expansion**: Public demand dictates which capabilities the model learns first through the decentralized incentive structure.
- **Beyond Transformers**: Integrate emerging state-of-the-art architectures like [early fusion transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09818), [diffusion transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08740), [liquid neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04439), and [KANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756).

## Current A2A Architecture ü§ñ

At launch, we are starting with an approach that builds on one of the most powerful and mainstream LLMs as a backbone: Llama 3. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) projects Imagebind embeddings directly into the pretrained Llama 3 internal state, allowing a finetuned model to develop video understanding.

The provided mining repo with default settings will train both:

-  the encoding projection layer, which encodes Imagebind embeddings into Llama 3 states, and
-  a LoRA adapter which allows the underlying LLM to develop multimodal understanding

There are several immediate areas miners can investigate in order to produce a checkpoint with improved multimodal understanding:

- Train for longer,
- Find better hyperparameters: learning rate, optimizer, batch sizes, gradient accumulation, etc.,
- Use additional datasets (more diverse, or even larger than the SN24 dataset),
- Try different LoRA parameters, or finetune all parameters.

In the near future we'll enable much deeper architecture search, allowing researchers to experiment with different LLM backbones, vastly different encoders and decoders.

## The Future of OMEGA A2A üîÆ

OMEGA A2A is poised to revolutionize the AI landscape by harnessing the power of Bittensor's incentivized intelligence model and attracting the world's top AI researchers. Our mission is to push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralized AI, focusing on:

- Developing fully multimodal, any-to-any models that outperform all other open-source solutions
- Creating an AI gateway framework to seamlessly integrate and evaluate models from across the Bittensor ecosystem and beyond
- Implementing task-driven learning and agent-focused validation to create models capable of completing complex, real-world tasks
- Powering up the OMEGA Focus app with cutting-edge multimodal intelligence and personalized digital twin companions

As we progress, we will explore fully decentralized infrastructure and governance to ensure a truly democratized AI ecosystem. Our research will explore groundbreaking architectures beyond transformers and attention mechanisms, pushing the limits of AI capabilities.

By hyper-connecting to the Œ© SN24, we will access diverse, high-quality data that fuels our models' growth and enables them to tackle a wide range of tasks. Innovative monetization strategies will be implemented to sustain and grow the ecosystem, ensuring long-term success and viability.

Through the tireless efforts of our decentralized OMEGA A2A research collective, we aim to showcase the immense potential of Bittensor's incentivized intelligence model and establish ourselves as leaders in the AI research community and beyond.

Join us on this transformative journey as we shape the future of decentralized AI, unlocking new possibilities and creating a more accessible, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem for all. :rocket:

## Incentives üéÇ

We aim to collectively push forward the SOTA of multimodal and agentic AI research. The incentives in this subnet will evolve as we add modalities and tasks, but they will consistently reflect this underlying goal.

The initial reward structure has two parts:

- Video understanding: can your checkpoint understand and accurately caption video embeddings?
- Language capabilities: does your checkpoint retain the language capabilities of the LLM backbone?

As we improve the incentive scheme over time to create better and more diverse multimodal capabilities, we'll give ample notice and detail of upcoming changes.
