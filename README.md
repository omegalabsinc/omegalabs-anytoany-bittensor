## Introduction

**OMEGA Any-to-Any** is a decentralized, open-source AI project built on the Bittensor blockchain by OMEGA Labs. Our mission is to create state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal any-to-any models by attracting the world's top AI researchers to train on Bittensor, taking advantage of Bittensor's incentivized intelligence platform. Our goal is to establish a self-sustaining, well-resourced research lab, where participants are rewarded for contributing compute and/or research insight.

**MainNet UID**: 21

**TestNet UID**: 96

## Our Vision

#### 🧠 A Multimodal-First Foundation

Our long-term focus is **true any-to-any modeling**—models that **jointly learn** from all modalities and express a **deeper understanding of the world** through associative representations. This isn’t just about data format translation; it’s about building models that **see patterns across domains**, capturing richer, more universal signals.

#### 🗣️ Starting with Voice-to-Voice

To build toward that future, our current focus is on **voice-to-voice generation**—training models that can fluently listen, understand, and respond. Speech is one of the most information-dense and underexplored modalities, making it the perfect starting point. Success here lays the foundation for more complex multimodal capabilities.

#### 📐 The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

As models grow, something remarkable happens: whether trained on images, text, or audio, **their internal representations begin to align**. We believe this trend is pointing toward a **shared statistical model of reality**—a *Platonic representation* where different modalities map to the same underlying concepts.

SN21 is designed to support that convergence: by evaluating, rewarding, and encouraging models that move us closer to this **unified understanding**.

#### 🛠️ Built for Builders & Researchers

SN21 aims to function as a **self-sustaining, open research lab** where contributors—whether they're providing compute, training models, or designing evaluations—are **incentivized for pushing the frontier**. With Bittensor's reward infrastructure, researchers and engineers are compensated permissionlessly for real impact.

#### 🌍 Open, Decentralized, Demand-Driven

We embrace a **community-driven roadmap**, where feedback, public interest, and real-world demand influence what we prioritize. Every update, benchmark, and leaderboard improvement is shared in the open. And in the future, SN21 will serve as a **high-bandwidth router** for specialized models across subnets, bootstrapping new applications with rich, multimodal embeddings.

---

### Our Commitment to the Community

```

#### Model Development & Testing

**🧪 Test Your Model Locally First**

Before deploying, use our testing framework to evaluate your model with the same logic validators use:

1. Start your voice model server with the required API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/v2t`
2. Test locally: `python -m tests.test_model_scoring_server --experiment_name "my-test"`

📋 **See [miner_testing_guide.md](docs/miner_testing_guide.md) for complete testing guide**

#### Model Deployment

1. Log into Huggingface: `huggingface-cli login`

2. Upload your model to Huggingface:
```bash
python miner_utils/upload_model.py \
    --hf_repo_id {HF REPO ID e.g. your-username/your-voice-model} \
    --wallet.name {miner wallet name} \
    --wallet.hotkey {miner hotkey} \

- **IfEval**: Instruction following
- **AdvBench**: Safety and robustness

**Scoring**: Advanced LLM-based evaluation measuring accuracy, fluency, and task completion across diverse voice scenarios.

### For Validators

To read the validator set-up documentation, see [docs/validator_setup.md](docs/validator_setup.md).

## Current A2A Architecture 🤖

At launch, we are starting with an approach that builds on one of the most powerful and mainstream LLMs as a backbone: Llama 3. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) projects Imagebind embeddings directly into the pretrained Llama 3 internal state, allowing a finetuned model to develop video understanding.

The provided mining repo with default settings will train both:

-  the encoding projection layer, which encodes Imagebind embeddings into Llama 3 states, and
-  a LoRA adapter which allows the underlying LLM to develop multimodal understanding

There are several immediate areas miners can investigate in order to produce a checkpoint with improved multimodal understanding:

- Train for longer,
- Find better hyperparameters: learning rate, optimizer, batch sizes, gradient accumulation, etc.,
- Use additional datasets (more diverse, or even larger than the SN24 dataset),
- Try different LoRA parameters, or finetune all parameters.

In the near future we'll enable much deeper architecture search, allowing researchers to experiment with different LLM backbones, vastly different encoders and decoders.

## The Future of OMEGA A2A 🔮

OMEGA A2A is poised to revolutionize the AI landscape by harnessing the power of Bittensor's incentivized intelligence model and attracting the world's top AI researchers. Our mission is to push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralized AI, focusing on:

Join us on this transformative journey as we shape the future of decentralized AI, unlocking new possibilities and creating a more accessible, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem for all. :rocket:

## Incentives 🎂

We aim to collectively push forward the SOTA of multimodal and agentic AI research. The incentives in this subnet will evolve as we add modalities and tasks, but they will consistently reflect this underlying goal.

The initial reward structure has two parts:

- Video understanding: can your checkpoint understand and accurately caption video embeddings?
- Language capabilities: does your checkpoint retain the language capabilities of the LLM backbone?

As we improve the incentive scheme over time to create better and more diverse multimodal capabilities, we'll give ample notice and detail of upcoming changes.
